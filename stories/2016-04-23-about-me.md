I am Mehmet Ali Ä°LGAR, a newly graduate Computer Scientist . I am also a programmer who defends the need of open source in the development of software ecosystem.

I have developed few game prototypes including, Tower Defence, Labyrinth, Pipe Puzzle solving game. Created a blog engine named [Kanepe][1], a tetris clone named [ArduStack][2] on arduino, [freedesktop-desktop-entry][3] node module that allows you to write and read desktop entry files. A simple wordpress [plugin][4] that adds novel navigation links to your posts.

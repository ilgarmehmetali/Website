This is a my first ludum dare(#35) gamejam entry_.

Theme of the gamejam was "shapeshift". I wanted to create a shapeshifting labyrinth that changes as you progress, even if you turn back you would face a new area.
The mood of the game came out pretty good i think, might turn this into something actualy worth playing.

I used Unity3D with C#, Blender and Gimp while making this.

You can play my entry here_ (25mb~)
